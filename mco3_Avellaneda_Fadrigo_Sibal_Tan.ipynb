An applicable dataset was chosen and was used on the 2 ML models. A deeper-than-surface-level understanding of the ML model in the context of the dataset is required"

Additionally the dataset was locally downloaded and can be found in \"/Spotify Dataset\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains about 30,000 songs of varying genres from the Spotify API using the [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) package. It contains information like the unique track ID, release date, genre, etc. \n",
    "\n",

    "The dataset has 23 columns they are as follows:\n",
    "1.  track_id: Song unique ID\n",

    "2.  track_name: Song name\n",
    "3.  track_artist: Song artist\n",
    "4.  track_popularity: Song popularity where higher is better|\n",
    "5.  track_album_id: Album unique ID\n",
    "6.  track_album_name: Song album name\n",

    "9.  playlist_id: Playlist ID\n",
    "10. playlist_genre: Playlist genre\n",
    "11. playlist_subgenre: Playlist subgenre\n",
    "12. danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on different factors like tempo, rhythm stability, etc. 0.0 denotes least dancable and 1.0 denotes most dancable.\n",
    "13. energy: Measured from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. \n",
    "14. key: The estimated overall key of the track.\n",
    "15. loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Typically range from -60 to 0 dB.\n",
    "16. mode: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track. 1 represents Major and 0 represents Minor\n",
    "17. speechiness: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. Values close to 1.0 likely indicate a talk show or podcast. Values above 0.66 means that tracks are probably made entirely of spoken words. 0.33 to 0.66 means that the track may have both music and speech. Values below 0.33 represent music or non-speech tracks. \n",
    "18. acousticness: Confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 whether the track is acoustic. A higher value means a higher confidence. \n",
    "19. instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. Values above 0.5 intend to represent musical tracks, with the values approching 1.0 denote a higher degree of confidence.\n",
    "20. liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Values above 0.8 indicate that a track likely recorded live.\n",
    "21. valence: Measured from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. \n",
    "22. tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). \n",

    "Originally, there were two candidate datasets to be used. [Spotify](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs) and [Android Malware Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/tuandromd). Initially, the researchers had considered using the malware detection dataset as it aligned with our main interest as a group, which is cybersecurity. However, after exploring both datasets more, the researchers had ultimately decided to use the spotify dataset and to classify the songs by genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the various features and labels of the dataset, the researchers had a lot of options like the modality or danceability of the songs. However, the reasearchers had decided to classify by genre as it is the most common and well recognized classification of songs. The features listed [here](#input_vars) allowed the researchers to realize that there may be some trends or patterns that exist in the music that allow it to be distnguishale from each genre. Overall, while the malware dataset aligns with the interests of the researchers, the spotify dataset had peaked the curiosity of the researchers. And taking advantage of the opportunity granted by this project to satiate that curiosity. "
